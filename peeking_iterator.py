# Problem: peeking iterator
#
# Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design
# and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it
# essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to
# next().
# 
# Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning
# of the list: [1, 2, 3].
# Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
# Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after
# that still return 2.
# You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling
# hasNext() after that should return false.
# 
# Think of "looking ahead". You want to cache the next element.
# Is one variable sufficient? Why or why not?
# Test your design with call order of peek() before next() vs next() before
# peek().
# For a clean implementation, check out Google's guava library source code.
# 
# Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all
# types, not just integer?
# Credits:Special thanks to @porker2008 for adding this problem and creating
# all test cases.
